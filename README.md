# AMATH 482 Computational Methods for Data Analysis
Homeworks I have done for this class, including codes(MATLAB/ Python) and reports<\br>

HW1: An ultrasound problem that using Fourier Transformation and Guassian filter to reduce noise and construct trajactory.<\br>
HW2: analyze a portion of Handel's Messiah with time-frequency analysis.<\br>
HW3: On Canvas are movies created from three different cameras. The experiments are an attempt to illustrate various aspects of the PCA and its practical usefulness and the effects of noise on the PCA algorithms.<\br>
HW4: use PCA to analyze songs and build a music classifier.<\br>
HW5: Build a Neural Network and CNN to classify images.<\br>
